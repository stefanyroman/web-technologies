        <h2>Can SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h2>
        <p>The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but it wouldn't be able to land. The Falcon Heavy can throw around 16,000 kg on a trans-lunar injection orbit, enough to send Dragon 2 to the Moon. However, Dragon 2 only has limited propellant and wouldn't have the required velocity change (âˆ†V) to land on the Moon.</p>

        <h2>What is Red Dragon?</h2>
        <p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule to Mars. The mission was an unmanned scientific lander and aimed to be the heaviest object ever to be placed on Mars, carrying additional equipment. There has been no official announcement about the project, and its funding remains uncertain.</p>

        <h2>Why does Dragon "berth" instead of dock?</h2>
        <p>The current Dragon capsule uses a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM), which is a larger port compared to the NASA Docking System (NDS). Berthing requires astronauts to use the Canadarm to carefully position Dragon, while docking is autonomous and faster. The CBM port on the Dragon is too large for the NDS port.</p>

        <h2>Could Dragon 2 land on Mars or the Moon?</h2>
        <p>Dragon 2 doesn't have enough propellant to land on Mars or the Moon. It would require a significantly larger propulsion system and more fuel to achieve a safe landing. SpaceX has focused on orbital missions and reentry but hasn't designed Dragon 2 for planetary landings.</p>
