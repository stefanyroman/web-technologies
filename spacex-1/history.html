            <h2>Dragon Spacecraft Development</h2>
            <p>SpaceX began developing the Dragon spacecraft in late 2004, with a public announcement made in 2006 and a plan for entering service in 2009. In 2006, SpaceX also won a contract to use Dragon for NASA's Commercial Resupply Services to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
            <p>During its maiden flight in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit. On May 25, 2012, a cargo variant of Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the ISS.</p>
            <p>SpaceX continued its contract to deliver cargo to the ISS under NASAâ€™s Commercial Resupply Services program, with Dragon beginning regular cargo flights in October 2012. Dragon's reusable nature was a key factor in increasing NASA's partnerships with the domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry.</p>
