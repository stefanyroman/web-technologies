                <h2>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h2>
                <p>The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but would not be able to land. The Falcon Heavy can throw about 16,000 kilograms on a trans-lunar injection orbit, allowing a Dragon 2 capsule to reach the moon. 
                However, Dragon 2 lacks the necessary ∆V (change in velocity) to land. 
                It could potentially be done with two Falcon Heavy launches, but further technology development is required.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What is Red Dragon?</h2>
                <p>Red Dragon is a proposed mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martian surface. It would be an unmanned scientific lander designed to carry up to 2 metric tons of cargo and equipment to Mars. However, there have been no official announcements or funding for this project from SpaceX as it is not managed by them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h2>
                <p>No. Dragon is too cramped, and its life support system would need significant improvements for a long journey. Elon Musk has stated that Dragon 2 can support seven astronauts for only "several days".</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Why does the Dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</h2>
                <p>The current version of Dragon cannot dock; it can only berth because it uses a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port, not a NASA Docking System (NDS) port. The advantage of the CBM is its larger diameter, but it requires astronauts to manually maneuver the capsule using the Canadarm and physically bolt the ports together. Docking is faster and autonomous.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h2>
                <p>Dragon 1 would make a poor lifeboat for the ISS. It does not dock and berths using the Canadarm, making evacuation slow and impractical. Moreover, Dragon 1 is not always at the ISS and does not have seats, limiting its suitability for evacuation. The Soyuz capsules are always available as a quick escape option.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h2>
                <p>No. Dragon lacks the necessary fuel and propulsion to reboost the ISS. Its SuperDraco engines are too powerful, and its docking ports cannot handle the force required. Current reboosting solutions work more effectively without modification.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h2>
                <p>The Dragon 2 weighs 9,525 kg, with 1,588 kg of propellant. It has a total delta-v of about 420 m/s, based on the thrust from its SuperDraco engines with a specific impulse of 235 s.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters failed during landing?</h2>
                <p>Dragon 2 can lose up to two of its eight SuperDraco thrusters without issue. The vehicle will deploy parachutes in the event of a thruster failure, and it will splash down in the Atlantic Ocean. It is not designed for land landings in case of a failure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</h2>
                <p>No. Draco engines are used for in-orbit maneuvers, adjustments, and deorbiting, with a thrust of 400 N. SuperDracos, with a thrust of 73,000 N, are much more powerful and designed for landing, not orbital maneuvers. Their power makes them unsuitable for in-orbit tasks, as they could damage surrounding structures like the ISS.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What is PICA-X? Does PICA-X ablate?</h2>
                <p>PICA-X is a heatshield material used on Dragon capsules. It is an improved version of the PICA heatshield used on NASA’s Stardust mission. PICA-X ablates less than traditional materials, making it more reusable. Dragon 2 employs PICA-X version 3, which allows for multiple reuses even at lunar or Martian velocities before needing replacement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h2>
                <p>Technically, Dragon 2 could service the Hubble, but economically, it is not feasible. The lack of an airlock and the cost of designing additional hardware make this a less practical option than simply building a new telescope. Hubble’s hardware is outdated compared to modern telescopes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Why does Dragon's trunk stay attached during an abort scenario?</h2>
                <p>The Dragon trunk helps stabilize the vehicle during an abort by preventing the capsule from flipping. The trunk’s fins and aerodynamic surface area help control the vehicle's orientation, which is critical during abort scenarios.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</h2>
                <p>The Dragon capsule begins deorbit by firing its Draco thrusters to ensure a safe reentry angle. Once in the atmosphere, the trunk is jettisoned, and the capsule aligns its heatshield forward. Drogue chutes deploy at 13.7 km, followed by main parachutes to slow the capsule for splashdown at sea level.</p>
