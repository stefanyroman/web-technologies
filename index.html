    <h2>Project Enhancement Writting Assignment</h2>
      <p>This by far would probably one of my favorite projects. I love how we got to experince and learn new ways to create a page, designed especially for the Elon Musk him self. It was fun creating the page over all.
        I was able to do my own personal research and combine the lessons that i learned form you and place it all onto my very own peice. I truly enjoyed it. However, somethings that I would probably do differently would 
        be to expand the time I soent on this project. I acknowledge the fact that I did not give my self enough time to work on this project causing my self to lack some of the skills that I know I could of demenstrated 
        only because I had limited time.</p>
        
   <p>Yes, I did have some things I wish I could of done differently but I also feel like I did some things correctly. I feel like I still put in the effort to make it look mnice. Something that honestly stood out and I learned
        along the way was how to place an image on the background of text. That was probably one of the most challenging yet coolist things I did on my project. One of those moments where I took a step back and was actually proud of 
        the work I did. Im proud of how the main page turned out with the background picture.</p>
      
    <p>Some of the feed back that I received from my first draft is that It looked too simple. Now I did agree with the facet that it seemed to simple but I also knew that my audience doesn't neccissarily care about looks rather than 
        what the template had to offer, as in information. Yet, I also did not want to bored my them so I did fix it. I changed the plane background and added my picture, with my logo. I am glad I took in the critique because It helped
        me create a page I was proud to say I created.</p>

      <p>Web accessibility is designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies that allows people with disabilities to use them effectively. 
      For example people with problems such as visual, hearing, and other disabilities. Its a big deal when it comes to help all individuals, regardless of their abilities, 
      in order to understand, navigate, and interact with web content.</p>
