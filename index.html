    <h2>Project Enhancement Writting Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        Progressive enhancement is where websites are built to work for everyone regardless of what device, browser, or internet adapter is being used. 
        It creates a simple website that works for all users, then adds advanced features like JavaScript, CSS or extra styles. 
        I think it is important in modern tech because it ensures that websites are accessible to everyone, including those with older devices or slower internet. 
        It also helps because it loads the basic version first, reducing data usage for users with limited bandwidth. Then progressive enhancement ensures that 
        websites continue to work as technology changes. It also offers users with up to date devices better experiences by providing upgraded features, 
        while still maintaining usability for those with out dates technology. Therefore, progressive enhancement helps create websites that are accessible and efficient.</p>

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision & Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Well, the Dragon project was absolutly one of the most challenging obstacles that this class had. Eventhough there where quite a few this one was definitely one of the hardest ones. I enjoyed creating these pages. Some of the 
        things that I struggled with was creating the subdivisions such as theh divs, contents, and the sections. Only because When I would go in and create one I would lose count of where Id place it, so when it was time to close it I 
        couldn't find it or I simple forgot to add it causing a break in my coding. That stressed me out for sure and especially when I though I was on the verge of thinking I finally understood it. 
        Another thing that I had some trouble with was remembering how the padding worked. I can not tell you how many times I struggled to correctly orginize and move the padding of a box into a certain position that eventually, led me to
        create a certain text box or if I need it to scoot a little further up or down. It seems easy but properly connecting it to the text was something I needed help on.</p>
        <p>I still ended up creating work that I was proud of as a student who just learned in one semester what HTML was. I know a lot of students already had previous experince with this kind of coding and formats but I did not. I actaully 
        changed my major from medical feild to programming enrolling in brand new classes. Even as a fresh mind of learning the ropes of HTML and CSS, this was a great project to help throw me in there and learn in a new and creative way.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts on web accessibility</h2>
      <p>Web accessibility is designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies that allows people with disabilities to use them effectively. 
      For example people with problems such as visual, hearing, and other disabilities. Its a big deal when it comes to help all individuals, regardless of their abilities, 
      in order to understand, navigate, and interact with web content.</p>
