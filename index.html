    <h2>Project Enhancement Writting Assignment</h2>
      <p>This by far would probably be one of my favorite projects. I love how we got to experince and learn new ways to create a page, designed especially for the Elon Musk him self. It was fun creating the page over all.
        I was able to do my own personal research and combine the lessons that I learned form you and place it all onto my very own peice. I truly enjoyed it. However, I do wish I would of done some things differently. For example, 
        I would probably do differently would be to expand the time I spent on this project. I acknowledge the fact that I did not give my self enough time to work on this project causing my self to lack some of the skills that I know 
        I could of demenstrated only because I had limited time.</p>
        
   <p>Yes, I did have some things I wish I could of done differently but I also feel like I did some things correctly. I feel like I still put in the effort to make it look nice. Something that honestly stood out and I learned
        along the way was how to place an image on the background of text. That was probably one of the most challenging yet coolist things I did on my project. One of those moments where I took a step back and was actually proud of 
        the work I did. Im proud of how the main page turned out with the background picture.</p>
      
    <p>Some of the feed back that I received from my first draft is that It looked too simple. Now I did agree with the facet that it seemed to simple but I also knew that my audience doesn't neccissarily care about looks rather than 
        what the template had to offer, as in information. Yet, I also did not want to bored them so I did fix it. I changed the plain background and added my picture, with my logo. I am glad I took in the critique because It helped
        me create a page I was proud to say I created.</p>

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision & Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Well, the Dragon project was absolutly one of the most challenging obstacles that this class had. Eventhough there where quite a few this one was definitely one of the hardest ones. I enjoyed creating these pages. Some of the 
        things that I struggled with was creating the subdivisions such as theh divs, contents, and the sections. Only because When I would go in and create one I would lose count of where Id place it, so when it was time to close it I 
        couldn't find it or I simple forgot to add it causing a break in my coding. That stressed me out for sure and especially when I though I was on the verge of thinking I finally understood it. 
        Another thing that I had some trouble with was remembering how the padding worked. I can not tell you how many times I struggled to correctly orginize and move the padding of a box into a certain position that eventually, led me to
        create a certain text box or if I need it to scoot a little further up or down. It seems easy but properly connecting it to the text was something I needed help on.</p>
        <p>I still ended up creating work that I was proud of as a student who just learned in one semester what HTML was. I know a lot of students already had previous experince with this kind of coding and formats but I did not. I actaully 
        changed my major from medical feild to programming enrolling in brand new classes. Even as a fresh mind of learning the ropes of HTML and CSS, this was a great project to help throw me in there and learn in a new and creative way.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts on web accessibility</h2>
      <p>Web accessibility is designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies that allows people with disabilities to use them effectively. 
      For example people with problems such as visual, hearing, and other disabilities. Its a big deal when it comes to help all individuals, regardless of their abilities, 
      in order to understand, navigate, and interact with web content.</p>
